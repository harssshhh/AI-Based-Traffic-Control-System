# Traffic Light Simulation Using Circular Queue

This is a simple Tkinter GUI based Python Program to simulate working of Traffic Lights using Circular Queue implementation

Technical Skills Used:

1. Data Structures And Algorithms
2. Python Programming
3. Tkinter Library (Python) For GUI
4. Adobe Photoshop


The basic concept behind the program is to implement a circular queue data structure along with its corresponing operations.

For each traffic light the red yellow and green color change in the circular queue. Similarly the position of green signal changes
in a circular queue order for each traffic light in a road square. This concept is integrated along with time modules available in 
built in python library to create a complete simulation of traffic light signals using circular queue implementation.
